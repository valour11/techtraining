
Git is a distributed version control system designed for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects simultaneously and efficiently manage code revisions. 

Git operates locally on each developer's machine, enabling them to work offline and commit changes to a local repository. 
Developers can create branches to work on specific features or fixes independently, and later merge those branches back into the main codebase. 

Git tracks changes using snapshots of files and maintains a history of commits, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed. 
It also supports remote repositories, allowing developers to synchronize their local changes with a central repository, such as GitHub. 

Overall, Git provides a robust and flexible platform for version control, enabling streamlined collaboration and efficient software development workflows.
