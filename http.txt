It is a fundamental protocol used for communication between web servers and clients on the internet. 
It facilitates the transfer of hypertext documents, such as web pages, by defining how messages are formatted and transmitted. 

HTTP operates as a request-response protocol, where a client(a web browser) sends a request to a server for a resource, and the server responds with the requested information, 
usually in the form of an HTML document. 

HTTP is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is essential for browsing websites, accessing web services, and exchanging data over the internet.
